                  <p>
                    I thrive on solving problems and personal improvement. 
                    During my Master's project, at the University of Oxford, 
                    I developed high levels of problem solving and data analysis skills that were necessary to model and visualize complex 
                    chemical systems.
                  <br><br>
                  After my degree, I took a role at the consulting startup Tunneys. 
                  In this role, I have developed skills in software and programming languages such as: Python, 
                  Power BI, Microsoft Fabric and Azure. Working at a startup has required independent and self-accountable learning. 
                  This involved implementing production level code & data analysis with little supervision often implementing new techniques 
                  and products that were previously not offered by the company, including Python notebooks, web-based reports,
                   Azure Lakehouse & Warehouse storage/analysis. 
                  <br><br>
                  In my career, I want to focus on the higher levels of problem solving required when working with Python. 
                  I have expanded my skills outside of work by researching python, implementing code in the form of solving 
                  tasks/problems and personal projects.
                  <br><br>
                  As a result, my programming and data analysis skills have increased dramatically over the 
                  last year and I am continuing to work diligently to further expand these skills.

                  <p>
                    As a Data Analyst, I use Python with Pandas & pySpark to process and analyse data. 
                    In my spare time I also build projects and solve data structures and algorithm problems.

                  <p>
                    I present data within Power BI and Excel. 
                    Along with building financial models using Excel and Power Apps to allow clients to enter data 
                    directly into the model/database within Sharepoint sites & Power BI reports.

                  <p>
                    Typically, client data is stored and managed using Data Pipelines 
                    & Warehouses/Lakehouses within Microsoft Fabric. 
                    Our systems allow for near real-time data processing and forecasting. 
                    My implementation of Data Pipelines allows for automatic refresh of 
                    analysis, stored SQL procedures & Python notebooks.

                  <p>
                    In addition to using SQL, many of our large-scale data transformations 
                    are performed using cloud-based fabric notebooks with Spark & Pandas. 
                    My forecasting has been completed using models such as SARIMA to predict 
                    the seasonality and adjust the trend of revenue etc.

                  <p><span><u>Financial modelling for startup companies.</u></span> 
                    <br><br>
                    I developed several financial models for startup companies, up to revenues of $10 M, 
                    that analysed core business metrics such as profitability, 
                    revenue growth and customer retention. This was done using Excel and Power BI with data being presented within 
                    Power BI reports and in Power BI Embedded reports hosted on Azure Web applications. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span><u>Financial modelling for a large Private Equity firm.</u></span>
                    <br><br>
                    I designed a financial model to analyse the performance of investments and funds by fund managers to present to 
                    shareholders on $100 M investments. As part of this, I cleaned and streamlined their data storage process to allow for extra 
                    fund analysis and future scalability. 
                    This enhanced the shareholders understanding of their fund finances & forecast profits.

                    <br><br>
                    I developed an Excel model with VBA Macros to allocate staff full time equivalence and schedule multiple pharmaceutical projects.
                    As part of this process, 
                    I implemented high levels of data validation and automation to improve model scalability and useability. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span><u>Improving company forecasting & analysis techniques.</u></span>
                    <br><br>
                    Since I joined the company, I have led the new implementation of analysis and forecasting on Microsoft Fabric using Azure Data Factory, 
                    Fabric notebooks with Python & Pandas. 
                    This has provided SARIMA modelling for our clients to forecast their revenue and profits. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span><u>Improving company data storage & processing methods.</u></span>
                    <br><br>
                    We have now moved our clients to a cloud storage and computing solution, using Data Warehouses/Lakehouses. 
                    This allows for scheduled and automated refresh for near real time data analysis and updating. 
                    Combined with Power apps, we enabled clients to directly add data into the SQL Endpoint from their reports.

                    My master's thesis focused on utilizing molecular simulations to simulate rod-like particle phase behaviour.
                    These simulations were performed using Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS).
                    The particles were modelled as a collection of hard spheres and molecular interactions (depletion interactions)
                    as Lennard-Jones potentials. This generated phase behaviour similar to the experimental and theoretical literature of these systems.

                    As a chemist many of the systems studied where highly complex chemical & physical systems. To predict and rationalize behaviour for these systems
                    you are required to clearly define model assumptions and then use the key patterns of your data/theory. 
                    It was always important to understand the margin of error and level of predictability that your model could provide and in addition 
                    where the model breaks down.

    <p class="intro"> This past year I have dedicated a large portion of my spare time to mastering Python and learning data structures & algorithms. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During my spare time by solving problems and building projects I have learnt a number of core programming principles. 
        While building my space invaders & tetris games, I learnt the value of writing short clean code and refactoring code.
        This has enhanced my ability to understand the code I have previously written, deal with bugs and iterate on this code. 
        Another important skill I have learnt is how to break down problems into smaller subproblems through techniques such as helper functions, recursion and divide & conquer.
